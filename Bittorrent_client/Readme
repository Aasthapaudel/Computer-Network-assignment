# BitTorrent Client

This repository contains a simple BitTorrent client implemented in Python. This client is designed to demonstrate the basic functionality of BitTorrent, including piece downloading and torrent management.

## Overview

BitTorrent is a peer-to-peer file-sharing protocol used for distributing large amounts of data efficiently. Instead of downloading a file from a single server, BitTorrent splits the file into smaller pieces and distributes these pieces among multiple peers. Each peer can download pieces from others and upload pieces to others simultaneously, which helps to speed up the download process.

## Components

### 1. `downloadpiece.py`
   - **Purpose**: Downloads a specific piece of a torrent file.
   - **How It Works**: This script connects to peers, requests a specific piece of the file, and saves it locally.
   - **Usage**:
     ```bash
     python downloadpiece.py
     ```
   - **Configuration**: Ensure that you have specified the torrent file and piece details within the script.

### 2. `downloadtorrent.py`
   - **Purpose**: Manages the downloading of the entire torrent file.
   - **How It Works**: This script handles the overall torrent download process, including connecting to peers, managing piece downloads, and assembling the complete file.
   - **Usage**:
     ```bash
     python downloadtorrent.py
     ```
   - **Configuration**: Ensure that the torrent file and other required settings are properly configured in the script.

## BitTorrent Protocol Details

1. **Torrent File**: Contains metadata about the files to be shared, including file names, sizes, and the hash values for each piece of the file. The torrent file is used to find peers and manage file integrity.

2. **Pieces**: The file is divided into smaller pieces, typically of 256 KB or 512 KB. Each piece is downloaded independently and assembled to form the complete file.

3. **Peers**: Computers that participate in the BitTorrent network. Peers share pieces of the file with each other, which allows for efficient file distribution.

4. **Tracker**: A server that helps peers find each other. It maintains a list of peers that have or want pieces of the torrent file. (Note: Some BitTorrent clients use DHT (Distributed Hash Table) instead of a tracker.)

5. **Seeding**: Once a peer has downloaded the entire file, they continue to share it with other peers. This process is called seeding and helps maintain the availability of the file.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries (if any)
